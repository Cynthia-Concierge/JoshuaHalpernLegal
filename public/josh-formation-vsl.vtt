00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.359
If you want to start an LLC, but it feels totally overwhelming,

2
00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:05.099
here's the simplest way to do it.

3
00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:07.460
Most people get caught up in the formation phase.

4
00:00:07.699 --> 00:00:09.760
They don't know what documents they need to file.

5
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.560
They don't know in what state they need to set up their entity,

6
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.140
and they don't know whether it should be classified as an S-Corp

7
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.299
or general partnership.

8
00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.639
If you mess up any of these steps, you could potentially cost yourself

9
00:00:19.639 --> 00:00:22.700
thousands of dollars in either taxes or liability.

10
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.440
That's why I created our business formation service.

11
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.139
We can help you set up a legally compliant

12
00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:31.280
and properly structured entity without confusion

13
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.340
and without the hassle and expense of engaging a traditional lawyer or law firm.

14
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.479
We handle everything from required corporate filings, documentation

15
00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:44.139
and helping you meet timelines that are imposed by your respective jurisdiction.

16
00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:45.279

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:49.439
